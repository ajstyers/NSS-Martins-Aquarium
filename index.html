          <p class="location-text">I got my Lionfish here. 
            Lionfish were introduced to the Western Atlantic in 1985, and have since become an invasive species.  
            Today, they flourish in the Gulf waters since they are not a native species and have few predators.  
            They are beautiful, but dangerous; human deaths from a Lionfish sting are rare, but its still 
            not fun to get a taste of their venom.  
            Lionfish are not the only invasive species that have been introduced to the Florida area - others 
            include the Burmese Python, Wild Boar, and the Giant African Snail.</p>

          <h3 class="location-details-header">Really deep puddle</h3>
          <img class="location--img" src="images/puddle.jpg" />
          <p class="location-text">Yea, this one was weird.  When I saw the puddle off of 440 East, it was 
            unassuming at first.  It wasn't very wide, but upon closer inspection, boy was it deep!  
            I didn't expect to find anything in it, so you can imagine my surprise when I saw a giant 
            oarfish near the surface - especially since these fish are usually found at depths of 200 meters!
